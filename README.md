## Project Overview:

+ ### Problem Definition 🎯
  This project poses a fundamental question: 
  *Can we leverage machine learning to accurately predict whether a patient has heart disease based on their clinical parameters?*

+ ### Data Source 📊
  The project draws inspiration from the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) and the [Kaggle Heart Disease Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset). These datasets provide a rich source of information for training and evaluating our predictive models.

+ ### Evaluation Metric 📈
  Success in this endeavor is defined by achieving an accuracy close to 90 % during the proof of concept. This ambitious goal drives the exploration and fine-tuning of various machine learning models.

## Key Highlights:

+ ### Features Overview 📋
  Explore a diverse set of features, including age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more. These features serve as the foundation for our predictive models.
  
+ ### Data Analysis and Visualization 📊
  Immerse yourself in the dataset using powerful data analysis tools such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Visualizations unveil patterns and insights crucial for informed decision-making.

  - Explore the correlation matrix to understand relationships between features.
